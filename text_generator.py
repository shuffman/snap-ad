Based on the vehicle details and photos provided, write a compelling listing that stops a buyer mid-scroll and makes them pick up the phone.

Car Details:
{_format_details(car_info)}{extra_block}

Write the listing using this exact structure:

# [Headline]
One punchy, specific headline. Lead with the year/make/model and a key emotional hook — not generic hype.

[Opening paragraph]
2-3 sentences. Paint the picture. Who is this car for, and why will they love it?

## What Makes This One Stand Out
3-4 sentences covering what's special: condition, history, trim level, rare options, or something that creates genuine trust (one owner, garage kept, recent work, etc.).

## Key Highlights
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- (5–8 bullets covering drivetrain, mileage, features, condition notes, and any extras worth calling out)

## The Bottom Line
2-3 sentences on value. Be specific about why the price is right — don't just say "priced to sell." Reference market comps, remaining warranty, or cost to replicate.

**[Call to action — one sentence urging immediate contact]**

Rules:
- Use the real data from the details; don't invent specs
- Be enthusiastic but credible — skip empty superlatives
- No clichés: "won't last", "rare find", "priced to move", "don't miss out"
- Target length: 350–450 words
- Output clean markdown only""",
